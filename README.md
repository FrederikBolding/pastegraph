pastegraph
==========

pastegraph is a Django-based web application which provides a pastebin-like service to share graph plots done by Graphviz.  It's mainly designed for ACM competitors and other people which sometimes want to visualize graph given by adjacency matrix or edges list.

As for now, the application is being deployed to Heroku: http://pastegraph.herokuapp.com/
